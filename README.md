👋 Hello, world! I'm Aman Tiwari, an Undergraduate student passionate about new Tech Innovations.

🚀 I love Technology/Programming Languages/Machine learnig and also I am enthusiastic about how machines can think like humans, and I'm on a journey to explore deep learning using neural network concepts with the help of Python libraries like Pyourch, TensorFlow, and so on... and I'm always eager to learn and collaborate.

🌱 Currently, I'm exploring Machine Learning  and Flutter framework. I believe in the power of community and open source, so let's connect and build amazing things together!

📫 Reach out to me on my social media account, and let's exchange ideas. You can also find me on Other Places like Twitter and so on...

⚡ Fun fact: If I am stuck on a code it will take me a full day for resolving that bug.
